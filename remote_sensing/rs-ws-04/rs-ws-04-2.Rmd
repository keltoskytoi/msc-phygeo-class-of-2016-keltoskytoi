* We tried to calculade the output images, but it took too long to proceed. We probably should have cropped it before filtering but due to the late hour (after waiting 2 hours for certain calculations) we broke down. 

* Theoretically the "mean filter" works on the basis of the mean. A reference pixel is chosen and the mean is calculated on the gound of the neighbouring pixels

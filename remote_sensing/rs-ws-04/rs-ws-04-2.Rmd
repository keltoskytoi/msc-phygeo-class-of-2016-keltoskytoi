* We tried to calculade the output images, but it took too long to proceed. 
We probably should have cropped it before filtering but due to the late hour 
(after waiting 2 hours for certain calculations)we broke down. 
* Theoretically the "mean filter" works on the basis of the mean. 
A reference pixel is chosen and the mean is calculated on the gound
of the neighbouring pixels

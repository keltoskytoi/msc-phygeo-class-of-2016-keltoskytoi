#####Prologue 

**Please note that I switched from Group 2 to Group 3 because my "timetable" didn´t give me time to meet with my group!** 


# **LiDAR derived information as raster data**



###LiDAR based intensity mean within each raster cell

*I used LAS to Dataset, All Point classes, First return, Intensity, Binning Average + Simple, INT, Cellsize, 1*

###LiDAR based height range within each raster cell

*I used LAS Punkt Statistics as Raster, All Point classes, All returns, Z-range, 1*

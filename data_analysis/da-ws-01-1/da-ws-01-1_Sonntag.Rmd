## **R Markdown Learning log entry**

***My favourite aspect*** is that this is the way I can start to understand how programming languages work including linux (ubuntu) and others. Being more of a social scentist and not a natural scientist it is had to get an entry which fits to our purposes. 

***Eureka effect*** so far: wow, this is what I want to learn. So far it is very logical and smoother to handle than I thought. I hope I´ll stay to this comment even after several weeks! 

***Questions***: I have too many

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 5
r1 <- sum(a,b)
r2 <- a-b
r3 <- prod(a,b)
r4 <- a/b
v1 <- c(r1,r2,r3,r4)
v1 <- c(v1,a**b)
print(v1)
v2 <- c("sum","difference","product","ratio","power")
print(v2)
df <- data.frame(v1,v2)
df <- data.frame(Results=v1,Operation=v2)
print(df)
print(df[3,1])
```
